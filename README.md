# NoSQL Social Network API with MongoDB  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

I wanted to build an API for social network web application where users can share their thoughts, raect to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It was important to use MongoDB for the database and Mongoose ODM for creating models, schemas, middleware, and queries. In addition, use Express.js for routing.

During this build, I was able to learn the fundamentals of building a NoSQL database using MongoDB, and furthered the architecture of the backend by using Mongoose.
